# My notes

This is an app created as a technical test, the subject is in `Test technique front 2019.pdf`.

I chose to implement it with react on top of which I added redux, react-redux, redux-thunk & react-router-dom. That was my first time with react so please be cool... ;-)

I didn't use any css framework for the styling, I just added the SASS preprocessor.

I chose (as it is just a technical test and I ran out of time) to implement unit / integration tests only for the redux reducers, where I believe is the most part of the logic in the app.

Thank you for giving me such a challenge, I realy enjoyed it ! :-)
